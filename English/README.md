# GPT-Assisted LinkedIn Cover Creator

Welcome to the GPT-Assisted LinkedIn Cover Creator (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), the tool that will transform your LinkedIn profile into a visual masterpiece reflecting your professional identity. Note: It is specialized solely for LinkedIn. For other platforms that require a different format or greater emphasis on specifications, it may not be suitable. Nevertheless, I invite you to experiment and provide me with your feedback through LinkedIn.

## Requirements for Using the GPT

To make the most of the GPT-Assisted LinkedIn Cover Creator, ensure you meet the following requirements:

1. **Access to GPT-4:** This GPT has been designed to work with OpenAI's latest generation of language models, GPT-4. You will need access to this technology to effectively use the GPT.
    
2. **Basic Interface Knowledge:** While the GPT will guide the creative process, it is beneficial to have a basic understanding of how to interact with programming interfaces and follow simple instructions for resizing or customization.
    
3. **Active LinkedIn Profile:** To apply the covers and business cards, you will need an active LinkedIn profile where you can make the necessary adjustments.
    

## How It Works

1. **Share Your Vision:** Tell the GPT about your job, your work philosophy, and how you want others to see you. Describe what you want to convey with your banner to start the creative process.
    
2. **Color Coordination:** You have several options to define the color palette of your banner. You can provide specific colors, request a general palette such as bright or impactful colors, or ask for colors that match your profile picture. If you're feeling adventurous, you can even ask the GPT to surprise you.
    
3. **Review and Adjustment:** Creating your image is a creative dialogue with the AI. Don't settle for the first option; you can ask for changes, adjustments, and improvements until the image faithfully reflects your professional identity.
    
4. **Ideal Image:** Once you and the Assistant have perfected the banner, it's time to adjust it to LinkedIn's format. The original banner is created in 1792 x 1024px Full HD 4K, but it can be manually cropped or resized to fit LinkedIn's banner size of 1584x396.
    
5. **Manual Cropping (Highly Recommended):** If you have started in manual mode, you will get a banner within a graphical interface ready for cropping, maintaining intact quality. You can also manually adjust it with LinkedIn's zoom tool for a perfect fit.
    
6. **Image Resizing for LinkedIn:** If you choose to resize the banner, you can choose between these two resizing options to fit the specifications of the LinkedIn banner (1584x396 pixels):
    
    1. **Internal Resizing with ChatGPT:** Use a Python script provided in the GPT instructions to resize your image quickly, applying a sharpness filter to achieve a suitable result.
    2. **Professional Resizing with External Tools (recommended):** You can also opt to follow the steps detailed by the GPT for a professional finish using Pixelhunter and Convertio, rest assured that these tools have been analyzed and evaluated to ensure the safety and integrity of your device, so you can be confident that they do not contain any type of malware.

## Manual Mode

This option fits well with manual cropping, as tests have shown good results because it is more intuitive in image generation. This process allows you to work alongside the GPT to create a design similar to what is seen in user interface presentations, making it much easier to adapt to LinkedIn's format, reflecting your unique professional identity. Through this mode, you can request specific adjustments. The final result is a custom banner that can be easily cropped to fit LinkedIn's required dimensions, without losing the original design quality.

## Conversation Starters:

"Conversation Starters" are phrases or questions designed to effectively start an interaction and are oriented. In the context of an artificial intelligence service or product like a GPT Assistant, "Conversation Starters" are preset commands that the user can select to initiate a specific process or guide the tool in performing a particular task.

1. **Let's create a cover for my LinkedIn profile**
    - General Interaction Starter: This is the initial prompt used to begin creating a LinkedIn profile cover. It can start in manual mode depending on the user's request, tailoring the design process to match the user's professional identity and preferences.
2. **Let's create a cover for another social network (beta)**
    - Experimental for Other Social Networks: This prompt allows users to create banners for social networks other than LinkedIn. Although it is in beta phase, the GPT can help adjust the design to meet the requirements and styles of various social platforms.
3. **What methods do you recommend for adjusting the image to my banner?**
    - Image Adjustment Techniques Information: Provides users with information on three different techniques to adapt their generated image to LinkedIn's cover format: crop-zoom, resizing by code, or resizing by verified external tools, ensuring they understand how to properly adjust their banner on the platform.
4. **Manual Mode to generate my LinkedIn cover:**
    - Manual mode: Works with a manual crop of the generated image. In this mode, the GPT is designed to produce banners in a "user interface mode," allowing users to adjust the banner directly on LinkedIn without needing to resize it. This process often requires more specific format details and can maintain image quality, sometimes being faster than the general method.
